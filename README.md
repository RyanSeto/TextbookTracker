TextbookTracker
===============

This program is a UI for tracking high school students' borrowed math textbooks. 

Background
----------
I was approached by my high school teacher back when I was in grade 11 to develop a system for tracking math textbooks. I created the UI in C# so that a teacher could easily enter the student information for a textbook that the student was to use for the term. Additionally, it has the ability to check the textbooks back in at the end of the term. There's some other utility such as searching for textbooks a student has out, student lists for a certain class, etc. The back end used is an MSSQL database.
